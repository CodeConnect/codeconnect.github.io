title: Code Connect is joining Microsoft!
---

We started Code Connect to build tools that help developers be as productive as they can be. Over the course of the last two years we built and shipped [Code Connect](http://codeconnect.io), [Source Browser](http://sourcebrowser.io) and [Alive](http://comealive.io).

At Microsoft we will continue full-time development on Alive and we'll be exploring different ways in which we can integrate Alive more closely with Visual Studio. Stay tuned for more information on this in the coming months.

Source Browser and the Code Connect plugin will remain under our control. We're considering different ways in which we can continue and improve these tools and grow a community around them.

If you have a current copy of Alive, it should continue to work with Visual Studio 2013 and 2015, but if you run into any issues or have any leftover questions about Alive, you can reach us directly at `aliveq@microsoft.com`.

We are grateful to our existing customers and the community, whose support at conferences, meetups and online has meant the world to us.

Thank you, and see you around!

Josh & Amadeus
